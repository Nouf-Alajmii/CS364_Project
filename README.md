## 1. Project Description
In this project, we built a Random Forest model to estimate the level of obesity of individuals with help of the [Obesity Levels & Life Style](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mpwolke/obesity-levels-life-style/notebook) dataset from Kaggle, which is a dataset that consists of 2113 records and 16 features varying between individual's physical condition and eating habits. This dataset is collected from the countries of Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. The model shows good performance with average of 96% accuracy. You can find the source code uploaded in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HPuAYoASXL5AhKDBH8fZVYzER7ZdK29F?usp=sharing) and you can run the code by downloading the Jupyter Notebook file, the installation steps is explained in section (3).

## 2. Programming language and envirnoment
The model is implemented using Python programming language with help of Jupyter Notebook. In the next sections we discussed the installation and running steps to run the Jupyter Notebook file containing the source code.

## 3. Installation requirments
In order to run the code, there are multiple things to be installed. In this section, we will explain the steps to install the Jupyter environment to run the Jupyter Notebook code file. Before starting to explain the steps, you have first to download the Jupyter Notebook file and the dataset excel sheet from this GitHub repository into your device, and they all must be in the same folder.

### 3.1 Downloading anaconda3

1. Download anaconda from [anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/) 
2. Choose the Operating System type.
3. Click on the "Download" button in the middle of the website's page.
4. After the downloading process is done, go to the Downloads folder in your device to get the installed anaconda.
5. Open the downloaded anaconda file and complete the setup.
6. After finishing the setup, search for "Anaconda Prompt (anaconda3)" in your device.
7. Click on Anaconda Prompt (anaconda3), which will display a command line.
8. In this command line, type in "jupyter notebook" and wait for seconds.
9. It will navigate you to the local hosts which will display all of the files in your device disk.
10. Search for the required jupyter notebook, which is possibly in the Downloads folder.
11. Click on the Notebook to open it.

All the previous steps are applied to Windows OS, since all the group members use this OS. If there are any conflict or confusing steps, you can see the [tutorial video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syijLJ3oQzU)

### 3.2 How to run
How to run:
After opening the Jupyter Notebook from the local host, now we will explain the running steps.

1. Click on "cell" option in the bar at the top of the screen, which will display a drop-down menu.
2. chose the "Run all" option to run the code.

If you want to rerun the code, do the following steps:
1. Click on "kernel" option in the bar at the top of the screen, which will display a drop-down menu.
2. chose the "Restart & Run all" option to rerun the code.

Note: it is recommended to execute the code in their order to avoid any errors.
